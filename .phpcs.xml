		* It complains about missing documentation on fully self-explanatory function headers
		  with strict type hints.
		* It complains about missing documentation if there is a proper @see tag.
		* It complains about duplicate spaces in "@param <type>  $<var>", but removing these
		  doesn't make the code easier to read.
		* It does not understand "@param <type> [$optional,…]. -->
